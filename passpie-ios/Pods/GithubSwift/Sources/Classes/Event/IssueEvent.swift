// The type of action performed on an issue or pull request.
//
// OCTIssueActionUnknown      - An unknown action occurred. Issue events will
//                              never be initialized with this value -- they
//                              will simply fail to be created.
// OCTIssueActionOpened       - The issue or pull request was opened.
// OCTIssueActionClosed       - The issue or pull request was closed.
// OCTIssueActionReopened     - The issue or pull request was reopened.
// OCTIssueActionSynchronized - Only available on pull request events. This
//                              action occurs when a pull request is forcibly
//                              sync'd with the underlying git state after a
//                              failed hook or a force push.
