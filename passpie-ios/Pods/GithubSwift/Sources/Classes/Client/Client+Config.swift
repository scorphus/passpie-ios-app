  // Note that, because the `clientSecret` will be embedded in your app and sent
  // over the user's internet connection, the secret isn't terribly secret. To
  // help mitigate the risk of a web app stealing and using your `clientID` and
  // `clientSecret`, set the Callback URL for your OAuth app to a URL you control.
  // Even if this URL is never used by your app, this will prevent other apps
  // from using your client ID and secret in a web flow.
  //
  // This method is thread-safe, and must be invoked before making any
  // authentication requests. This will have no effect on any clients that have
  // already been created.
